                <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
                <p>It’s a good idea to start thinking about your personal statement early. Admissions officers read thousands of these, and it can be hard to make yours unique, so you’ll want to start brainstorming some experiences you’ve had that could be transformed into compelling stories. <br><br>

The PharmCAS personal statement can be a maximum of 4500 characters (note that this is less than the 5300 characters that AMCAS allows). The guidelines for the essay are as follows (as of 2013): “Your Personal Essay should address why you selected pharmacy as a career and how the Doctor of Pharmacy degree relates to your immediate and long-term professional goals. Describe how your personal, educational, and professional background will help you achieve your goals. The personal essay is an important part of your application for admission and provides you with an opportunity for you to clearly and effectively express your ideas.”
<br><br>
You’ll most likely want to have a draft of your personal statement done sometime during the spring semester of your junior year. This will give you plenty of time to write several drafts. Let as many people read it as possible! You don’t have to take everyone’s advice, but each person will pick out different things that you may not have noticed about your grammar or content. At the same time, try not to get too attached to your first draft, as you will probably need to make lots of changes before you submit.<br><br>

Personal statements have been addressed extensively across the web. Basically, you want your essay to read as unique, and you want your readers to know very explicitly why you want to and deserve to be a pharmacist, without feeling like they are simply reading your resume. Here are a few sites with some good advice:<br>
<a href="http://studentdoctor.net/2007/06/before-you-write-your-personal-statement-read-this/">http://studentdoctor.net/2007/06/before-you-write-your-personal-statement-read-this/</a><br>

        <section id="Recommendations">
            <div class="container">
                <h1>Recommendations</h1>
                <p>As early as possible, you’ll want to start thinking about recommendations. You may connect well with a professor during your freshman or sophomore year, but if you don’t keep in touch, it will be hard for that person to write you a good letter of recommendation when the time comes. At the same time, professors who you’ve only had for a class in the spring of your junior year may not feel they know you well enough to write an effective letter.
PharmCAS allows a maximum of four letters of recommendation to be uploaded with your application. Occasionally, some schools you apply to may ask for extra letters to be sent directly to them, but the vast majority should accept at least some of the four that you upload. <br><br>

The strongest set of letters will be from a variety of people in your life. Usually the only people that are prohibited from writing letters of reference are family, friends, and occasionally, politicians or clergy. For pharmacy school, it’s best to have at least one letter from a science professor, and at least one from a pharmacist with whom you’ve worked. Other letters may be from a work supervisor or a professor of another subject. If you choose to get a committee letter, be aware that this will count as one of your four letters that can be uploaded. Check the PharmCAS School Pages to see which of the schools you are applying to will accept a committee letter.<br><br>

When it comes time to ask for the letters, you should be extremely prepared. It’s recommended that you compile a folder for your references (either physically or electronically) with information about you that will make the letter writing process as easy as possible. Include a cover letter, addressed personally to the reference, that thanks them for their help and outlines some themes of your application. This website addresses the construction of your cover letter: <a href="http://practicalpremed.com/2012/02/16/write-a-cover-letter-for-better-letters-of-recommendation/">http://practicalpremed.com/2012/02/16/write-a-cover-letter-for-better-letters-of-recommendation/"</a> 
<br><br>
With the cover letter, include a copy of your resume or CV and a copy of your most recent draft of your personal statement. You may have other things, such as a recent publication, that could be included alongside these other documents. Keep in mind that if you are asking very far ahead of time, references may lose track of these documents, so be prepared to re-send them closer to the letter deadline if necessary. Make sure you mention explicitly to each reference that you are applying to a Pharm.D. program, and not a Ph.D. program – many faculty do not know the difference and will use them interchangeably, so be sure they understand your plans before they write you a letter!
<br><br>
As far as timing goes, you should probably ask for the letters toward the end of the spring semester of your junior year. You could also wait until the summer, but keep in mind that you will most likely have to do all of your correspondence via phone or email, and this gives the letter writers less time before the deadline. Choose a deadline for your references and stick to it. This should be a date right around when you plan to e-submit your PharmCAS application, so that you can make sure everything is complete before you submit. (PharmCAS will send your application on even before they receive all of your letters of reference, but it provides some peace of mind to know that all parts of your application are being submitted simultaneously.) Sometime in July is probably a good deadline, especially if you want to submit your PharmCAS application and get started on your supplementary applications before the fall semester of your senior year.
<br><br>
Importantly, the letter submission process is different from the one that medical school applicants use. Pre-med students are asked to submit their letters of recommendation via AdviseStream, the site that is also used to arrange for your committee letter interview. The health professions officers then package faculty letters with the student’s committee letter and send them in bulk. However, PharmCAS recommends that you have your references submit their letters directly to the PharmCAS website. This is largely because of the questionnaire that references are asked to fill out before uploading their letter, which asks questions about how they know you and their confidence in your competency. Because references need to fill this out personally, the process is much more streamlined if you simply wait until the PharmCAS application has opened. Once this occurs, you can enter each reference’s name, email, and phone number on PharmCAS. Once you submit this information, PharmCAS automatically sends the person an email, inviting them to complete their letter of reference. You will be able to see whether they have opened the application, and the date when they have completed the letter. 
In fact, even the committee letter can (and probably should) be submitted in this way, since PharmCAS has officially switched to electronic-only letters of reference. This will be discussed in the next section.

                <h1>Committee Letter</h1>
                <p>Obtaining a committee letter is a complex but worthwhile process. Duke is a school that is known to emphasize the importance of the committee letter, and some medical schools have been known to ask why you have chosen not to obtain a committee letter if your school offers them. While most pharmacy schools probably will not ask this question, it is a good idea to make maximal use of your resources here at Duke. <br><br>

It is recommended that you attend one of the HPA Kick-Off meetings in the fall or winter of your junior year, in order to hear about the timeline of applying for a committee letter. This process will be nearly identical for both pre-medical and pre-pharmacy students, except for the fact that you will probably have to clarify that you are applying to a different type of professional school. <br><br>

You will need to obtain an AdviseStream account early in the spring semester at the latest. You will be asked to enter a lot of information about your course history, extracurricular activities, and experience with medicine, among other things. The HPA requires that you have the Academics and Engagement Planner, Reviewing my Application Form, Pre-Application Short Answer Essays and Resums sections updated with relevant information before requesting a committee letter. As of now, the site has not been personalized for any career path other than medicine, so you will have to mentally replace each instance of “medicine” with “pharmacy”, and fill it out based on your own experience. <br><br>

You will have to manually enter each course you’ve taken, the instructor, grade received, and a reflection – most of this information can be copied directly from ACES. Although many of the reflection spaces seem unnecessary, it is recommended that you fill out as many as possible, both for your later benefit when filling out your PharmCAS application, and so that your committee letter interviewer can get a good sense of who you are as a person. <br><br>

The rest of the sections on AdviseStream are grouped somewhat oddly, so just try your best to fit your extracurricular experiences into one of the categories; you will be given the option to give each activity a primary and secondary category designation. <br><br>

The committee letter for pre-pharmacy students will be written by the pre-pharmacy advisor, Cindy Broderius, so you might not need to follow the same procedures as the pre-med students in signing up for a committee letter interview. It would be a good idea to get in touch with her regarding the committee letter interview after you have completed the required sections on AdviseStream. Ms. Broderius is familiar with the PharmCAS application process, and she will upload the letter directly to PharmCAS once she completes it.

        <section id="PharmCAS">
            <div class="container">
                <h1>PharmCAS</h1>
                <p>The PharmCAS application opens in June, over a year before your matriculation. The application cycle is indeed very long, but this doesn’t mean you should put things off! Many pharmacy schools use rolling admissions, so the earlier you finish your application, the better. If you finish your application early in the cycle, you could ideally start hearing about interviews and possibly even admission decisions before the end of the calendar year. <br><br>

When the application opens, however, it should not create a large amount of additional work. You should be mostly prepared to apply by this point in your undergraduate career, with your personal statement nearly finished, your shadowing experiences recorded, and your extracurricular activities well established. The hardest part of filling out PharmCAS should be the tedium of copying things over from your existing records. <br><br>

When the application opens and you have created an account, you will see that the application is divided into several sections, each of which will be “checked off” (marked with a small orange box) once you have completed it. Many of these sections are self-explanatory, and simply ask for your demographic information, criminal history, etc. The ones that will matter the most are the following: Coursework, Extracurricular, Work Experience, Professional Licenses and Certifications, Honors and Scholarships, Publications, and of course, the Personal Essay. <br><br>

Coursework is by far the most tedious section to complete; keeping a window open with your transcript open in ACES will make it go as quickly as possible. You will have to enter the course name, number, subject, grade, and any special notes for every completed and planned course. Be sure to enter the course name exactly as it appears in ACES – this will speed up the verification process once you submit your grades to PharmCAS. Also, note that Duke only counts 2 AP courses, but PharmCAS will give you the full 4 credits for each AP class listed on your transcript. Also make sure you separate your courses by semester – if you forget to do this, you will have to go back and re-enter each course that is misplaced. <br><br>

The Extracurricular section encompasses many things on PharmCAS: any extracurricular, volunteering, or shadowing experiences you’ve had in college. You are asked to enter them in order of importance to you, so make sure to organize them in a list before you start entering them on PharmCAS. Include each shadowing experience separately if possible, but just remember that you are limited to 20 activities. <br><br>

Work Experience refers to any experiences for which you were paid – it is recommended that you include volunteering under Extracurriculars and not under Work Experience. <br><br>

Professional Licenses and Certifications is fairly self-explanatory – for example, if you had earned your pharmacy technician certification, you would enter it in this section. 
<br><br>
Honors and Scholarships should include things like a dean’s list honor, or an honor given to just some of those within your major, for example. PharmCAS asks that you only enter placement on the dean’s list as one honor, even if you’ve achieved it multiple times.
<br><br>
For the Publications sections, include any publication on which you are listed as an author. There does not seem to be a way to include pending publications, so if this is the case, you may just have to find a way to mention this in another area of your application (or on your supplementary applications). 
<br><br>
The Personal Essay will have to be entered as plain text, and a character count is given below the text box. Make sure that when you copy and paste the essay, it does not exceed the 4500 character limit. It may also be helpful to prevent formatting errors by first pasting your essay into Notepad and checking the way it looks there.<br><br>

All of these sections are explained in great detail in the PharmCAS FAQs – you can follow these as you complete your application.

            <div class="container">
                <h1>Supplemental Application</h1>
                <p>After you complete and e-submit your PharmCAS application, immediately start looking into supplemental applications. Contrary to popular belief, not all pharmacy schools require you to be invited to complete the supplemental applications. Instead, many schools make the application publicly available and ask every applicant to complete it. Check the PharmCAS School Pages for each school you applied to in order to determine the process each school uses. If the supplemental application is immediately available, the link will most likely be given on the PharmCAS School Page.<br><br>

Most schools ask you to create an account on their website in order to complete the supplemental application, so make sure to keep track of your username and password for each of the schools. Schools use supplemental applications for a variety of reasons – some use it as part of the evaluation process, while others may just use it to confirm that you meet their health and academic requirements. Be prepared to write at least one additional essay, in most cases, and pay attention to character limits, as they vary widely from school to school. <br><br>

Supplemental applications have an additional fee, on top of the fee you pay PharmCAS to have your application sent. You may be asked to pay this fee before or after completing the supplemental application. Deadlines for these applications range from November to March, but again, it is to your advantage to submit these as early as possible, especially at schools with rolling admissions. Once these are submitted, you’ll just be waiting to hear back about interviews and acceptance decisions!

            <div class="container">
                <h1>Multiple Mini Interviews</h1>
                <p>Many pharmacy schools are following the lead of medical schools and adopting the Multiple Mini Interview (MMI) as their primary in-person interview method. While this format may seem new and daunting, it can actually be quite fun and a chance to show several different evaluators who you are and what you can bring to the table. <br>
There are many resources online to help you prepare for the MMI, including videos and practice questions. Here are some resources to get you started:<br>

MMI Fact Sheet: <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/caps/files/caps/guide_mmi_faq.pdf">https://www.mcgill.ca/caps/files/caps/guide_mmi_faq.pdf</a>
<br>
U.S. News and World Report (note the four types of MMI scenarios described in this article): <a href="http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/medical-school-admissions-doctor/2015/02/24/what-to-expect-during-a-medical-school-multiple-mini-interview">http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/medical-school-admissions-doctor/2015/02/24/what-to-expect-during-a-medical-school-multiple-mini-interview</a>
<br>
In addition, it’s important to check the admissions websites of the pharmacy schools at which you will interview for information about the MMI procedures at that institution. While there is a general format for MMIs, schools differ in their processes, number of interview stations, and types of questions asked. Checking the websites beforehand can give you a better idea of what to expect on interview day.
<br><br>
MMI Mythbusters
<br><br>
Myth 1: The MMI is scary! It’s much more high-pressure than a traditional, one-on-one interview.
<br><br>
This myth is commonly spread among prospective interviewees for health professions schools, but it’s absolutely not true! The MMI is NOT scary – it can actually be really fun if you are mentally prepared for the process and maintain a positive attitude throughout the experience. Also, this type of interview actually places less pressure on your individual interactions with interviewers. In a one-on-one interview, you truly have one chance to make a good impression and show the interviewer that you are a strong candidate. In an MMI, you have seven or eight chances to do this – just think, at least a few of the MMI interviewers are bound to like you! 
 <br><br>
Myth 2: The trick to the MMI is figuring out what the “right” answer is to each scenario. If you don’t get the answer right, you get a lower score.
<br><br>
False! The MMI isn’t about coming up with the “right” answer to the scenario posed to you, because there are no right answers! The best approach is to commit yourself to one solution or point of view, and defend your perspective clearly and logically. If and when the interviewer responds with follow-up questions that ask you to reconsider your initial response, remember to stay strong and continue to defend your original perspective. Duke has taught you to think on your feet in order to solve problems quickly AND defend your position – have confidence that you can devise logical answers to any questions posed to you.
<br><br>
Myth 3: If an interviewer was not very receptive or did not look happy, I definitely failed that station.
<br><br>
The 5-7 minutes you will spend with an MMI interviewer will not represent a typical conversation. When you enter the room after reading the scenario, you will do most of the talking as you present and defend your position. The interviewer may respond with follow-up questions (see Myth 2 for tips about answering these), but for the most part the reins are in your hands! In many cases, MMI interviewers are following a set of rules about how to behave; so while you may see an interviewer as cold, stone-faced, or non-responsive, he or she is most likely just following orders and trying to appear as unbiased as possible (which is difficult, because of course he or she can’t help but love you).
<br><br>
Myth 4: You can’t prepare for the MMI interview, because you have no idea what questions you will be asked.
<br><br>
WARNING: You will see this type of statement on some pharmacy school admissions pages. What the schools mean by posting this is that you won’t be able to predict exactly what scenarios will be posted at each station. However, just because you don’t know the scenarios doesn’t mean you can’t prepare yourself for the MMI experience! Here are some tips to ensure that you are as ready as can be for this interview format:
<br><br>
1. Participate in a mock interview. Going through the physical motions of the MMI will (1) help you to get a feel for the time limits and (2) prevent anxiety or confusion on interview day. You can set up a mock interview with our favorite pre-pharmacy advisor Cindy Broderius (highly recommended), or find an organized MMI mock interview through the UNC Pre-Pharmacy Club or pre-health organizations at Duke. UNC’s SNPhA chapter offers two day PCAT preparatory review sessions for about $150 where they conduct mock MMI interviews using UNC’s past interview questions. The PCAT review itself is a bit rushed, but their mock interview is a very good practice to prepare you for the actual MMI. 
<br><br>
2. Look up practice scenarios online. While it’s highly unlikely that schools will use the same scenarios as those posted on the internet, you can learn more about the types of questions that will be asked on interview day.
<br><br>
3. Dig deep into that Duke education! Many MMI questions come in the form of an ethical dilemma to which there is no single or correct response. However, these questions are designed to test your capacity for compassion, empathy, and doing the right thing. Your college education has prepared you to think critically and promote equality, fairness, and following the rules. Your health care experiences have taught you the importance of compassion and protecting patients’ safety and well-being. Draw on these experiences when faced with an ethical dilemma, and you can’t go wrong!
<br><br>
4. Practice your communication skills. When you only have 5-7 minutes to convince the interviewer that you are the best future pharmacist that school has ever seen, you have to get straight to the point! It’s important to speak clearly and confidently not only in the MMI, but in any interview format. Pharmacists have to be good communicators, and schools are looking for students who show promise in this arena. Practice eliminating “um”, “like”, “you know?”, etc. from your professional vocabulary.
<br><br>
5. Be ready for traditional interview questions. Many schools will throw in a “traditional” station, where they ask questions like: “Why pharmacy?”, “Why our school?”, or “What will you contribute to the field of pharmacy?” You can and should prepare to answer these types of questions! Think of these as “freebies” – you can spend time beforehand crafting beautiful responses, plus you can ask your advisors and friends for feedback in order to perfect your answers.
<br><br>
6. Come up with your very own MMI plan, and stick to it.
<br>
Here’s Duke alumna Carolyn Rath’s MMI plan:
<br>
1. Arrive at station. Take a drink of water (carry a water bottle with you to place outside the door at each station) and a few deep breaths to clear mind from previous station.<br>
2. Read scenario one time quickly, and then again in more detail. Pick out important points to remember, like the names of the imaginary people in the scenario (this will show that you’re paying attention!).<br>
3. Make a mental outline of your argument (you won’t be able to write anything down); include a “thesis statement” and a list of logical supporting points; if there are multiple questions involved, make sure you have answers ready for each of them.<br>
4. With remaining time, reread the scenario, plan out a strong introduction, or brainstorm potential follow-up questions the interviewer could ask and how you might respond.<br>
5. When the bell rings, enter the room with a HUGE smile and introduce yourself confidently to the interviewer. Time to *dazzle*
