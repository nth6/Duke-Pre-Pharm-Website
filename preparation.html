                <h1>Course Requirements</h1>
                <p>Course requirements for pharmacy schools can differ greatly, unlike medical schools, which seem to have a very set list of courses required for admission.
Almost every pharmacy school will require:<br>
•	2 general chemistry courses (with lab)<br>
•	2 organic chemistry courses (with lab)<br>
•	2 biology courses (with lab)<br>
•	1 calculus course<br>
•	1 statistics course<br>
•	2 English/writing courses<br>
•	1-2 anatomy and/or physiology courses<br>
•	1 microbiology and/or 1 biochemistry course<br><br>
Other commonly required courses include macro- or microeconomics, public speaking, psychology or social science; more advanced biology courses are occasionally also required. Some schools also have a very specific set of electives they’d like you to fulfill. Note when looking at course requirements that 1 unit at Duke counts for 4 credits/semester hours.<br><br>

Again, these requirements differ from school to school. Be sure to check which schools require which courses – it may be strategic to apply to schools with similar course prerequisites. The American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) provides an overwhelming but comprehensive spreadsheet of each school’s prerequisites here: http://www.aacp.org/resources/student/pharmacyforyou/admissions/admissionrequirements/Documents/pre_reqs-2017-18%20FINAL.pdf <br><br>

In addition, AACP provides a packet containing general information about each school (including course prerequisites) that can be helpful when deciding which schools to apply to. The packet is found here: http://www.aacp.org/resources/student/pharmacyforyou/admissions/admissionrequirements/Pages/PharmDSchoolInformation.aspx <br><br>

If you choose not to study abroad, it should be very easy to fit all of these requirements into your schedule; in fact, you should rarely have to take more than one or two of these courses at a time. If you choose to study abroad, you may have to double up on science courses or take some classes over the summer, but this is definitely still possible. Just be sure to get started as early as possible! <br><br>

Some of the Tricky Requirements: <br>

-	Public Speaking/Debate- Duke offers a public speaking class (PubPol) in the public policy department. The class is quite popular, so it might be hard to get in as a freshman or sophomore. It is also offered as a 4-week course during the summer, which is a lot easier to get into. <br><br>
-	Micro/macroeconomics- some school may accept your AP credit for this requirement. Duke’s economic courses are intense and may be too much work to add on to the science prerequisites you are already taking, so I would recommend taking this course at a community college or another university during the summer. Some pharmacy schools may requires specifically micro or macro, make sure you take the right one. <br><br>
-	Human Anatomy/Physiology- Most pharmacy schools require some sort of Human Anatomy/Physiology course or sequence of courses. Some schools require only a general Physiology course, while others specifically require a Human Anatomy/Physiology course with lab, while still others require a two-semester sequence of Human A/P. The most surefire way to ensure that you meet these requirements is to check the prerequisite course listings of the pharmacy schools on your application list as early as possible in your pre-pharmacy journey. <br><br>

However, here’s one important tidbit – DON’T PANIC if it seems you’re running out of time to complete the Human A/P requirement, or any other pharmacy prerequisite for that matter. There are many options available to you to get these courses done if you are not able to take them at Duke, including online courses (if approved by your respective pharmacy school), summer courses at a different institution, or a post-baccalaureate program at a different institution if you’re taking a gap year before pharmacy school. <br><br>

One more tip – it would be helpful to take a Human A/P course before taking the PCAT, since this information is included in the Biology section of the test. While it is totally possible to self-study the Human A/P info for the PCAT, it’s much easier to simply refresh what you’ve already learned in class before the exam. <br><br>

If you are determined to fulfill the Human A/P requirement whilst at Duke, here are some course options that may be available to you: <br><br>

a. Duke course: EVANTH 330L – Human Anatomy and Physiology, with lab <br>
• Generally offered every summer at Duke; not difficult to get a spot during summer <br>
• Potentially offered during the semester (last time was Spring 2015); difficult to secure a spot during the semester due to high interest from pre-med seniors; the best approach is to politely and persistently contact the professor to explain that you need the course for PCAT preparation and pharmacy school admissions <br>
• This course is not a two-semester sequence; the professor from Spring 2015 (Dr. Daniel Schmitt) offered to write students a letter to affirm that the Duke course covered all information that would be covered in two semesters at another institution <br><br>

b. Duke course: EVANTH 333L – The Human Body, with lab<br>
• Generally offered every summer at Duke; not difficult to get a spot during summer<br>
• Generally offered at least one semester per academic year at Duke; difficult to secure a spot during the semester due to high interest from pre-med seniors; the best approach is to politely and persistently contact the professor to explain that you need the course for PCAT preparation and pharmacy school admissions<br>
• This course is strictly an anatomy course, and does not include a physiology component<br>
• One option would be to take this anatomy course and take a separate course in physiology, such as CELLBIO 503 – Introduction to Physiology (see (3) below), to cover the physiology requirement<br>
• If you’re thinking of taking two separate classes to count for the Human A/P requirement, make sure to check with your prospective pharmacy schools to see if those courses would meet their requirements<br><br>

c. Duke course: CELLBIO 503 – Introduction to Physiology<br>
• This course is strictly a physiology course, and does not include an anatomy component<br>
• Also, this course is not limited to human physiology, but rather covers cell physiology in general – check with your prospective pharmacy schools to see if this course would meet their requirements<br>
• As explained in (2), one option would be to take this physiology course and take a separate course in anatomy, such as EVANTH 333L <br><br>

d. UNC course: BIOL 252 – Fundamentals of Human Anatomy and Physiology, with lab<br>
• In the case that Duke courses in Human A/P are not available when you hope to take them, you can set up an Interinstitutional Agreement through Duke-UNC in order to take this course at UNC-Chapel Hill<br>
• Note from UNC website: “This course may not satisfy the requirements of non-UNC professional programs that require 2 semesters of A&P”; thus, if you were to take this course, you might still need to take another anatomy and physiology course at Duke or another institution. <br>
• If you take this course with Dr. Johnson, all the lectures are recorded and posted online, which would save you some trouble from having to commute to UNC when the semester starts getting busy. However, there might be a participation component to your grade based on the Poll Everywhere question that goes live during lectures.

            <div class="container">
                <h1>Extracurriculars</h1>
                <p>The amount of extracurricular activities that Duke offers can be overwhelming. It can be hard to figure out which activities will be the best fit for you, especially during your first year. However, the best thing to do is dive in! Go to the Activities Fair at the beginning of the year and listen to each club’s pitch. Choose a few things that match your interests and try them out – clubs know that not everyone who comes to the first meeting will eventually become a member of the executive board. It’s okay to explore.<br><br>

As far as pharmacy school goes, admissions officers will want to see relevance, leadership, and commitment. Relevance means that you have supplemented your pre-pharmacy preparations with some activities that align with your interest in pharmacy. This may mean joining the Duke Pre-Pharmacy Union, tutoring younger students in science, or working with some kind of health-related charity or community service opportunity.<br><br>

Leadership will be an important quality to show in your application. When you are looking for extracurricular activities, consider whether each group seems like somewhere that you would have the opportunity to be a leader. Some clubs make it very easy to move up in rank to a named position, while others may provide smaller but more frequent opportunities for leadership. It may also be beneficial to continue with an activity you did in high school, such as Relay for Life or club sports.<br><br>

Finally, it’s good to show commitment to a few activities, rather than spreading yourself too thin. If you find an activity you enjoy, try to stay active throughout your undergraduate career.</p>

        <section id="Experience">
            <div class="container">
                <h1>Gaining Experience</h1>
                <p>Gaining pharmacy experience is a very important thing to do before you apply. Pharmacy schools will want to see that you have spent significant time working in the healthcare field and in pharmacies specifically; this shows that you know a lot about the field and that you have made an informed decision to become a pharmacist. It will also give you a lot more to talk about in your personal statement and during interviews. (Plus, you’ll want to get to know at least one pharmacist for when it comes to asking for letters of reference!) <br><br>

Ideally, you should try to shadow in a number of different types of pharmacies. At a minimum, try to experience a community pharmacy (both independent and chain, if possible) and a hospital (inpatient) pharmacy. Other possibilities include shadowing the critical care pharmacist in the hospital ICU or learning about the responsibilities of a nuclear pharmacist. Finding these opportunities will depend on you making connections with people in the healthcare field. Don’t be afraid to ask people if they’ll allow you to shadow them – most are more than willing!<br><br>

If you’re not sure what to ask the pharmacist while shadowing, here’s a list of potential questions: a) what led you to pursuing a career as a pharmacist?; b) how do you spend your time doing various parts of your job, e.g. patient contact, paperwork, consultations, etc.?; c) what about your career do you find most satisfying/rewarding?; d) what advice would you give me at this point? Think: what do I want to know about this person’s work that will help me prepare/make a decision about this career?<br><br>

In North Carolina, you can work as a pharmacy technician without being certified, so applying to retail pharmacy technician positions is a good way to start gaining experience. Having worked in a pharmacy will also help you a lot on the certification exam. Getting your pharmacy technician (CPhT) license may allow you to have a bit more freedom when shadowing or volunteering. For example, some independent community pharmacies and the VA Medical Center across the street from Duke may allow you to volunteer as a pharmacy technician while shadowing, making the experience more worthwhile for both of you. You can find information about becoming a certified pharmacy technician on this website: <a href="http://www.ptcb.org/">http://www.ptcb.org/</a>

            <div class="container">
                <h1>Summer Experiences</h1>
                <p>One thing to immediately note is that it’s never too early to start searching for a summer experience. Many programs start posting applications for the following summer as early as October of fall semester. Start looking around this time to get an idea of what may be out there. This website (<a href="https://people.rit.edu/gtfsbi/Symp/summer.htm">https://people.rit.edu/gtfsbi/Symp/summer.htm"</a>) is one of the most comprehensive listings of summer opportunities across the country, and has up to this point stayed relatively updated for each summer. You can also try looking up opportunities at specific universities and pay attention to the pre-health announcement emails that the HPA sends out every week. Keep in mind that many of these opportunities will ask for letters of reference from professors, and you may need to ask for these early in the preceding spring semester.<br><br>

The specific type of summer experience does not necessarily matter, as long as it is worthwhile and meaningful to you. If you have to work at an unrelated summer job, try to do some shadowing in your free time. If you have a choice of jobs, try to find something in the healthcare industry, particularly pharmacy technology if possible. If you are looking at internships, many biology and chemistry research positions are applicable to pharmacology and/or pharmacy and will be an asset to your application.

                <h1>Undergraduate Timeline</h1>
                <p>Freshman Year<br><br>

•	Start taking pre-health courses. Start the chemistry track, either in Gen Chem I or Organic Chemistry I, and ideally, take a chemistry course both semesters. This will also help you realize early on if the arduous course load isn’t for you.<br>
•	Attend pre-health orientation programs, keeping in mind that these are heavily geared toward pre-medical students.<br>
•	Meet with the pre-pharmacy advisor, Ms. Cindy Broderius and to talk about your proposed career path. She will be able to help you connect with other pre-pharmacy students and possibly some shadowing opportunities at Duke Hospital.<br>
•	Seek out relevant extracurricular activities such as science-based clubs, and look for activities in which you feel you could be a leader.<br>
•	Start looking for summer experiences toward the end of fall semester/beginning of spring semester and apply early.<br>
•	If it fits in your schedule, look for an on-campus job in a laboratory or in the hospital, where you can gain research or healthcare experience.<br>
•	Find out about the prerequisites required for pharmacy schools that you are interested in to have an idea of the must-take prerequisites that most schools require. You should start planning early, especially if you want to study abroad.<br><br>
 

Summer after Freshman Year<br>

•	Participate in a worthwhile summer experience. Consider also shadowing or volunteering in a healthcare field.<br>
•	Or, take a summer course and work. This may be necessary if you plan to study abroad.<br>

Sophomore Year<br><br>

•	If you haven’t already, start laying out a plan of courses for the rest of your undergraduate career (ACES allows you to do this on their website). Make sure you can sufficiently spread out your prerequisites, so that you aren’t overwhelmed in any one semester.<br>
•	Declare your major in the spring (side note: the chemistry minor is basically a given for any pre-health student).<br>
•	Start looking at which pharmacy schools you would be interested in attending. Note that each school has its own specific list of prerequisites (some may not accept AP credit for certain courses), so make sure your schedule can accommodate these.<br>
•	Keep track of your experiences – note hours of shadowing, meaningful interactions, and interesting stories that can be used later on in your application.
<br>

<br>



Summer after Sophomore Year<br><br>

•	Again, participate in a relevant summer experience. Consider working as a pharmacy technician and earn your CPhT certificate. If you need to work elsewhere/can’t find a relevant job, try to gain volunteer and shadowing experience in your free time.<br>
•	Pick out 4-8 schools that you plan to apply to. If possible, make connections with people at these schools: call their advising office to make sure you are on track, plan for tours of their pharmacy schools, etc.
<br><br>

Junior Year<br><br>

•	Start brainstorming about your personal statement. Keep track of any meaningful experiences that could be your “hook”.<br>
•	Double check that your courses fulfill all the prerequisites, and plan for any special prerequisites for specific schools you are interested in.<br>
•	Begin studying for the PCAT, either on your own or through a study program (Kaplan, Princeton Review, etc.)<br>
•	Take the PCAT, either in January before spring semester, or June/July after the end of the school year.<br>
•	Fill out AdviseStream – this is necessary for the committee letter, and will help you think about your experiences before you have to enter them on PharmCAS.<br>
•	Ask faculty/work supervisors/pharmacists for letters of recommendation toward the end of spring semester. Note to recommenders that you are applying for a Pharm.D., not a Ph.D.<br>
•	In the spring, apply for the committee letter and complete the interview (make sure at least some of your schools will accept this as a letter of reference).<br>
•	Write a first draft of your personal statement before the end of the semester.<br><br>

Summer after Junior Year<br><br>

•	Start PharmCAS as early as possible – it usually opens in early June. Submit as soon as possible.<br>
•	Work on supplementary applications after completing PharmCAS. Note that some schools require you to be invited to complete these, while others have them immediately available on their website.
<br><br>
Senior Year
<br><br>
•	Finish supplementary applications, if necessary (usually due by the end of the calendar year).<br>
•	Go to interviews – note that you will usually have to pay for travel and accommodations.<br>
•	Find out about your acceptance(s) by May of spring semester.<br>
•	After receiving acceptances, start gathering the required health documents and complete all the immunization requirements before the deadline. 
<br><br>
Summer after Senior Year<br><br>

•	Prepare to start your next four years of pharmacy school!

        <section id="PCAT">
            <div class="container">
                <h1>PCAT</h1>
                <p>The PCAT (Pharmacy College Admissions Test) is the standardized test that is required for admission to nearly all pharmacy schools (California schools are some of the only exceptions). The PCAT includes 6 sections: Verbal Ability, Quantitative Ability, Reading Comprehension, Writing, Biology, and Chemistry. Each section is scored out of 600, and your composite score is also out of 600. However, PCAT scores tend to be reported based on your percentile rank, from 1 to 99 (how well you did compared to a subset of others taking the test).<br><br>

Although it sounds like science is a minor part of the overall test, the Biology and Chemistry sections will be very important to study for. Certain subjects within these sections, such as organic chemistry or anatomy, are very specific and will require you to brush up on them a lot, especially if you have not taken a class on them recently.<br><br>

One helpful recommendation is to treat studying for the PCAT as a “fifth class”, on top of your normal four course load. Because it can be difficult to devote an appropriate amount of time to your studying, a study class can often be helpful. Kaplan provides a number of options for study courses, depending on your preference for in-person vs. online and your schedule flexibility. If registering for one of their classes, be sure to watch for specials and discounts – for example, if you take their free practice PCAT before registering, you earn $100 off toward any class. Their page is here: <a href="http://www.kaptest.com/PCAT-NAPLEX/Home/index.html">http://www.kaptest.com/PCAT-NAPLEX/Home/index.html</a> <br><br>

Self-study materials can also be helpful, if you have confidence in your ability to maintain a study schedule. Companies such as Kaplan and Princeton Review publish study books for less than $50 that are updated each year. The PCAT’s format was changed significantly in 2012 – for instance, plant biology was removed and distributions of questions were changed, so try to get a recent study book that reflects the updated test. Another popular study guide is Dr. Collins PCAT Self Study Course. It costs $375 but you should be able to find used or older versions on Amazon. <br><br>

I personally used Dr. Collins and Kaplan’s book to study for the test. Dr. Collins provides a really good review for the subjects and does not go into unnecessary details like other study guides. However, Dr. Collins’ reading and math practice tests, and the passage problems in its biology and chemistry are easier than those on the actual exam. I would recommend purchasing at least one of Pearson’s Official PCAT Practice Test and do it after you have reviewed all the materials to get a sense of the difficulty and length of the actual test. – Catherine Sun <br><br>

Test dates tend to be clustered in a few months of each year. July, September, and January are the most popular times to take it. It’s best to choose an approximate test date first, and structure your study schedule around this. For example, if you choose to take the PCAT in January of your junior year, you should spend at least the second half of fall semester, as well as much of winter break, preparing. If you choose to take the test in July after your junior year, spend the second half of spring semester and the beginning of your summer preparing. <br><br>

Signing up for the PCAT requires several steps: you’ll first have to make an account on http://www.pcatweb.info and then register for a specific date, time, and testing center through Pearson’s website. Be sure to read all of the information on the PCAT website before registering – it contains a lot of hints about how to prepare, what to bring to the test, etc. <br><br>

When you sign up and designate the schools that you want your scores to be sent to, make sure to include PharmCAS as one of these (code 104). If you send your score to PharmCAS, it can be sent from there to all of the pharmacy schools that participate in PharmCAS, lowering your fees dramatically. You do not need to designate both PharmCAS and the individual schools, as long as they participate in PharmCAS! If you plan to apply to schools that do not participate in PharmCAS, be sure to designate their school codes when you sign up as well.
